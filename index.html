  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better. Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.Learning in a library Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups can do things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.</p>

  <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education in India</p>
  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Gurukul was India’s first system of education. It was a residential schooling system dating back to around 5000 BC, where shishya and guru used to reside in the guru’s ashram or in close proximity. This allowed for an emotional bond to be developed prior to the transmission of knowledge. The mode of communication was the ancient Sanskrit language. The basis of learning wasn’t only to read books and memorise information, but also incorporated the holistic development of a child. This includes their mental, cognitive, physical and spiritual wellness. Subjects taught were religion, holy scriptures, medicine, philosophy, warfare, statecraft, astrology and more. The emphasis was on developing student’s human values such as self-reliance, empathy, creativity, plus strong moral and ethical behaviours. The aim was that this knowledge could later be practically implemented to find solutions to real-life problems. Aims for the future of education in India Now we know a bit about the past state of education in India, what can we expect to see in the future?Like many other countries, the pandemic has pushed a need for digital involvement in the education sector in India. Along with this, we can expect to see a shift in skills-based education as opposed to qualification-lead education. By 2030, it’s estimated that India’s higher education system will have more than 20 universities among the global top 200 universities. It’s also thought that it will be among the top five countries in the world in terms of research output, with an annual research and development (R&D) spend of US$140 billion.  </p>
